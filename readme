Docker Basics

1. Create Dockerfile with all the commands

   a. FROM command - which pulls the base necessary (images) requirements depencies for running our app. Eg: node image for Node application
   b. WORKDIR command - to create a dir in container where we put all the code in container
   eg: WORKDIR [workdirname]
   c.COPY command - which copies all the files from current target(source) to destination(work directory which we set in container)
   d. RUN command - RUN the commands in container
   e. EXPOSE command - which exposes the post for ruinning in container
   f. CMD command - which takes array of string as commands to execute

2. docker build . -> To build the image form dockerfile from current directory

3. docker images -> to see the list of build images

4. docker ps -> to see list of running containers

5. docker run imageName -> to run image
   docker run -p 4000:4000 imageName ( -p tag [publish] to map container running port to local port)
   docker run -p 4000:4000 -it imageName (-i [interactive] tag to run container in interactive and -t [tty] to get terminal in use -d[detached] from terminal so app runs in background).
   docker run --env-file .env -it -p 4000:4000 imageName - to make use of .env file to replace environment variable in container

   docker networking

   - docker create network <network_name>

   - docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>
